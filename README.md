# Cash or Die
#### Game made in pure Python

### How it works
You start the game. You will be greated by a robot which will ask for your name. After that, then game starts. You start with 50 cash, 0 tokens and 0 coffee. To get cash you need to either sell coffee or tokens. To get coffee, you need to steal it from a school where teachers keep them. To get tokens, you need to gamble in a casino. Here's the catch, risking your money in a casio is pure luck, meaning if you loose you will loose all your money while if you win you get a shit ton of money. Don't want to risk it? Try stealing coffee instead, it is less risky and requires skill but be careful, the police might catch you! remember, cash is important to have, you won't have enought time to pay up.

## Source

The project is open source so I really don't care what you do with it, I mostly did this for fun so have fun looking into it if you are new to python or something.

## Installation

You can download the .exe or the source, both works great.
